It supports lyrics display, lyrics karaoke style display, lyrics online download, lyrics editing, song tag recognition, album cover display, album cover online download, spectrum analysis, sound effect settings, taskbar thumbnail button, theme color, format conversion and other functions.\r\nThe playback kernel is the Bass Audio Library (V2.4).\r\nThe player supports almost all common audio formats. A detailed list of supported files is shown in the ""Supported Formats"" of the ""Help"" menu.\r\n\r\n[Operating Instructions]\r\nYou have the following ways to open and play a song:\r\n1.

Drag and drop the file or folder directly into the program's main window.\r\n5. Drag and drop the file or folder directly onto the program's icon or its shortcut icon.\r\n\r\n[Media Library]\r\nClick the ""Media Library"" button in the upper right corner of the main interface, or use the shortcut key ""Ctrl+T"" to open the Media Library dialog box.\r\nThe media library provides two modes of folder and playlist to manage and organize music.\r\nIn the folder mode, each time you open a folder for playback, the player will automatically search the audio files in the folder and load them into the playlist. At this time, you cannot add, delete, move up, and down on the items in the list.\r\nIn playlist mode, you can create a playlist and freely add audio files to the playlist. In this mode, you can freely edit the items in the list, and add, delete, move up, move down and other commands are alse in the available status.\r\nThere are two special playlists in playlist mode: ""Default"" and ""My favourite"", you can't perform renaming and deleting on these two playlists. Among them, the audio file opened from the Explorer will be added to the ""default"" playlist. Clicking the ""Favourite"" button in the main interface will add the current song to the ""My favourite"" playlist.\r\n\r\n[Switch interface]\r\nCurrently MusicPlayer2 provides 2 built-in UI layouts and several user-defined UI layouts.\r\nAll UI layouts can be switched through the main menu ""View"" - ""Switch UI"" submenu. Use the shortcut ""Ctrl+U"" to switch all available UI layouts in turn, or use the shortcut ""Ctrl+number"" keys to switch to the specified interface.\r\n\r\n【User-defined UI】\r\nMusicPlayer2 supports custom UI layout through xml files. User-defined UI files are placed in the ""skins"" directory under the directory where the program is located.\r\nThe UI 1 to 2 that under the ""Switch UI"" submenu are the UI layouts built into the program, and the other UI are provided by the xml files in the skins directory. To learn how to edit the user-defined UI layout, click ""Help"" - ""Custom UI"" in the main menu to view detailed instructions on the user-defined UI.\r\n\r\n[Shortcut key description]\r\nPlay/Pause: Spaces\r\nPrevious Song: V\r\nNext Song: N\r\nFast Forward for 5 sec: Right\r\nRewind for 5 Seconds: Left\r\nVolume Up: Up\r\nVolume Down: Down\r\nSwitch Repeat Mode: M\r\nQuick Find: F\r\nSelect Folder: Ctrl+T\r\nFind Songs: Ctrl+F\r\nOpen File Location: Ctrl+B\r\nOption Settings: Ctrl+I\r\nOpen File: Ctrl+O\r\nOpen Folder: Ctrl+D\r\nLyrics Adjustment: Ctrl+PgUp/Ctrl+PgDn\r\nSave Lyrics Adjustment: Ctrl+S\r\nMini Mode: Ctrl+M\r\nTrack Information: Ctrl+N\r\nSound Effect Settings: Ctrl+E\r\nFull Screen: F11\r\nShow/Hide playlist: Ctrl+L\r\nFloat playlist: Ctrl+K\r\nAB Repeat: Ctrl+R\r\nSwitch UI: Ctrl+U/Ctrl+Num key\r\n\r\n[Mouse Action]\r\n- Use mouse wheel to adjust volume.\r\n- Hold Shift and click the right mouse button to pop up the system menu."
